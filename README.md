# 🐾 Fine-Grained Animal Species Identification using Vision Transformers

Welcome to the **Animal Species Identification** project! This repository showcases a deep learning solution for classifying animal species with fine-grained accuracy using **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**. It's designed to help improve biodiversity studies, conservation research, and automated wildlife monitoring.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Identifying animal species from images is a challenging task — especially when the differences between species are very subtle. This project addresses that by using a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture combined with a **ConvNeXt feature extractor** to improve classification performance on fine-grained image datasets.

The model learns not just broad categories (like "bird" or "cat") but specific species, even when they look very similar.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- 🦾 Vision Transformer integrated with ConvNeXt backbone
- 📸 Preprocessed animal image dataset
- 🧪 Model training and testing scripts
- 📊 Metrics, evaluation reports, and visualizations
- 🔬 Focus on fine-grained classification (not just coarse animal categories)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- PyTorch 🔥
- Hugging Face Transformers 🤗
- NumPy & Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈
- Scikit-learn 🧪

## 🧪 Results
